# stencil-backbone-example

This is an extremely barebones example of a Web Component built using [Stencil](https://stenciljs.com/) that integrates with a single-page app using [Backbone](https://backbonejs.org/).

Stencil supports several different [output targets](https://stenciljs.com/docs/output-targets). This project uses [the ESM version of the `dist` target](https://stenciljs.com/docs/distribution) for simplicity.

## 1. Build components

1. `cd components`
1. `npm ci`
1. `npm run build`

## 2. Run sample app

1. `cd app`
1. `npm ci`
1. `npm start`
